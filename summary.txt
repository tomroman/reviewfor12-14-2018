Summary

We went over the postman program which allows us to test our api keys to see if 
they work and how quickly they pass, without needing to complete
the rest of the front end. After an error in the class we went over 
closing the git bash so as to not cause errors in the console of the 
terminal. After solving the errors we moved to Express, which is an npm package 
not included in Nodejs. 

While we were introduced to Express we learned about how to code our routes so that they fetch 
what the user wantes to to be displayed on screen. If we are to use a get route we need to make sure that 
the route includes a response so that the server can give the user what they were 
searching for. Through the Starwars example we then examined the post route. This route 
enables the user to change or add things to the back and and it requires (req) as part of
the arguments of the function. Through the hot restaurant example we were able to see how 
routes are fundamental to the modern app experience, as routes encourage and enable
interactivity between the user and the app.

This day included more lecture than is usual for this course. Having never seen express 
before it looks as though we were more encouraged to understand the underlying principles 
of the how the express server works. Almost all of the starwars activities and the hot 
restaurant activity required very little coding to be done. As the servers were already 
created and routed. Poornima fielded questions most of the day with reguard routes and 
and functionality.
